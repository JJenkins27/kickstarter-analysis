# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project

An analysis of the Kickstarter campaigns to uncover trends that may contribute to a campaign's success. 

### Purpose

Louise is launching a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for her upcoming play, Fever. She anticipates over $10,000 in costs. The purpose of this analysis is to show Louise similar Kickstarter campaigns and how their attributes may or may not have contributed to the campaign's success.  	

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The chart below shows the number of Kickstarter campaigns in the theater parent category based on the date the campaign was launched. Most of the successful theater campaigns were launched in May and steadily declining over the summer months. The least ideal month to launch a theater campaign would be in December. Overall, Kickstarter theater campaigns are successful in raising enough funds to meet their goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The chart below places goals into buckets based on amount of funding requested in theater/plays category and the percentage of those campaigns that have succeeded or failed. Those campaigns that have asked less than $1,000 goal are the most successful at a rate of 76%. With Louise asking for $10,000, the success rate is only 54%, but still favorable.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

No challenges or difficulties were experienced in gathering the necessary data for analysis.

## Results

- Due to the successful trend of theater campaigns shown on the "Outcomes based on Launch Date" graph, my recommendation is to launch the Kickstarter campaign in May or the subsequent summer months, if possible. Additionally, I would not recommend December to launch a campaign.. 

- The $10,000 that Louise has requested has a higher rate of success than failure. However, I would not recommend asking for more than $15,000 as it has an equal chance of failure as success.

- There are some limitations to this dataset. What is not quantified is how marketing could affect the outcome of the campaign. In addition, another factor that could attribute to success of a campaign is the originality and interest of the idea which is not quantifiable. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
